    description: Tweenshot is a personal project that I created. It is a webapp that
      allows users to style tweets from their timelines or people they follow
      and generate a downloadable screenshot (or TWEENSHOT) of the Tweet. This
      app was built using NextJS and deployed to Netlify.

  - company: Carter's
    role: Senior UI Developer
    description: At Carter's, I am on the team responsible for the redesign of the
      cart and checkout process of the Carter's, Oshkosh and Skiphop websites. I
      introduced Vue to the manage state on the Cart as a proof of concept for
      the larger site. That later was adopted into the Cart page.

  - company: Hooters
    role: Front-end Developer
    description: Hooters is a client of Morrison Agency. They asked Morrison to
      redesign their main website. I was asked to chip in on some of the
      development of this large project, along with various emails, landing
      pages for their advertising campaigns, like http://munchies.hooters.com.

  - description: Mitsubishi Electric is a client of Morrison agency. They are
      putting their latest HVAC line on road and displaying it at various
      locations across the United States. The experience is all seen in a truck
      they have outfitted with their HVAC systems. To bring awareness and
      display the schedule of the truck, they asked Morrison to create a website
      with a map and calendar of when and where the truck will be. Utilizing
      Perch, Mapbox and a custom PHP calendar, I gave them a bespoke way to
      display this information.

  - description: good2grow is a client at Morrison Agency. Morrison was commissioned
      to rebrand the company, Inzone Brands, that had an awesome product, Tummy
      Ticklers. Not only did we rename the company good2grow, we also gave the
      company an entire new brand identity. This included a new website. I took
      the lead on developing the company's website. The site was developed out
      using PHP, CSS3, Javascript, and Perch CMS. The Wonderwall on the homepage
      is a custom API that pulls in various social media sources to output to
      the rotating cards.

  - description: Sqwincher was a client of Morrison Agency. They sell a beverage
      that work like Gatorade but, in my opinion, better. They DEFINITELY do
      great for hangoversâ€¦at least that's what I've been told. We were initially
      asked to re-do the entire brand but instead we were asked to do the
      website. The site was developed using PHP, CSS3, jQuery and Perch as the
      CMS. There was a wonder wall built that allows the company to display the
      social media of their more celebrity users of the products.

      Simavita is a client of the Morrison Agency that specializes in
      incontinence technologies. Being a leader in that technology space, they
      wanted an advanced website to compliment their brand. The website was
      developed on top of Perch CMS and featured a parallax-driven story on the
      homepage speaking to the company's vision.


      We were asked to deliver an updated experience to their current training portal that is used globally to educate various medical professionals on their incontinence technology. The portal can only be accessed via username/password. The training portal was built using Perch and includes quizzes, videos, custom certificates and various educational material for the user.
